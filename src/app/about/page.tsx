                    <h2>What is Chetna?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Chetna</strong> (चेतना) is a Sanskrit word meaning "awareness" or "consciousness." It represents the essence of our platform: a space for self-reflection, understanding, and conscious decision-making through the lens of Vedic astrology.

                    <h2>Why Vedic Astrology?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Vedic astrology, also known as Jyotish (the "science of light"), is an ancient system of knowledge that originated in India over 5,000 years ago. Unlike Western astrology, which focuses on the Sun sign, Vedic astrology uses:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Sidereal Zodiac</strong> — Based on the actual positions of constellations in the sky</li>
                        <li><strong>Divisional Charts (Vargas)</strong> — For deeper insights into specific life areas like relationships, career, and spirituality</li>
                        <li><strong>Dasha Systems</strong> — Planetary periods that reveal timing and life phases</li>
                        <li><strong>Nakshatras (Lunar Mansions)</strong> — 27 lunar constellations that add nuance to planetary influences</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        We believe Vedic astrology offers a profound framework for self-understanding, not because it's "true" in a scientific sense, but because it provides meaningful patterns and archetypes that resonate with human experience.

                    <h2>What Makes Chetna Different?</h2>

                    <h3>1. Awareness-First Approach</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most astrology platforms focus on predictions: "You will meet someone special," "You'll get a promotion," etc. Chetna takes a different path. We emphasize <strong>awareness over prediction</strong>. Instead of telling you what will happen, we help you understand the energies at play, the lessons being presented, and the choices available to you.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. No Fear-Mongering</h3>
                    <p>
                        Traditional astrology often relies on fear—malefic planets, bad doshas, inauspicious transits. We reject this approach. Every planetary influence has both challenges and gifts. We help you see the full picture, not just the scary parts.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Personalized & Dynamic</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your birth chart is as unique as your fingerprint. We provide deeply personalized insights based on your exact birth time and location. Our AI-powered clarity sessions allow you to ask specific questions and receive tailored guidance, not generic horoscope text.
                    </p>

                    <h3>4. Modern Technology Meets Ancient Wisdom</h3>
                    <p>
                        We use cutting-edge AI and precise astronomical calculations to generate your charts and interpretations. Our platform combines the timeless wisdom of Vedic astrology with the convenience and accessibility of modern technology.
                    </p>

                    <h3>5. Transparency & Authenticity</h3>
                    <p>
                        We're honest about what astrology can and cannot do. We don't make false promises or exaggerated claims. Our disclaimers are clear: astrology is for awareness, not certainty. Your life is yours to create.

                    <h2>A Note from the Creator</h2>
                    <p>
                        Chetna was born from a simple realization: most people approach astrology looking for answers, but what they really need is <em>awareness</em>. Awareness of their patterns, their strengths, their blind spots, and the energies influencing their lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to create a platform that respects your intelligence, doesn't manipulate through fear, and genuinely helps you understand yourself better. Chetna is not about dependency—it's about empowerment. Use it as a mirror, not a crutch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether you're a lifelong astrology enthusiast or a curious skeptic, I hope Chetna serves your journey toward greater self-awareness and conscious living.
